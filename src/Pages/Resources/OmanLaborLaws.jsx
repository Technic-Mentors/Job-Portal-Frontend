                Oman’s labor laws address several important areas to protect employees and define employer obligations. Some of the key aspects include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><span className="fw-bold">Employment Contracts:</span> All employees must have a written employment contract outlining terms of employment, including job role, salary, working hours, and other essential details. This contract ensures transparency and mutual understanding of rights and obligations.</li>

                <li><span className="fw-bold">Working Hours and Overtime:</span> The standard working hours in Oman are eight hours a day or 48 hours a week. Any additional work beyond these hours qualifies for overtime pay, which is calculated at a higher rate. Special provisions are also made for reduced working hours during Ramadan.</li>

                <li><span className="fw-bold">Wages and Benefits:</span> Oman’s labor laws guarantee timely and fair payment of wages. Employers are required to pay salaries by a specified date each month, and any delays or violations can result in penalties. The law also addresses leave entitlements, such as annual leave, sick leave, and public holidays, ensuring employees can balance work with personal needs.</li>

                <li><span className="fw-bold">Termination and Resignation:</span> Both employers and employees have rights and obligations when it comes to ending an employment relationship. Oman’s labor laws provide guidelines for resignation, notice periods, and termination conditions, including severance pay for employees who have served a specified period.</li>

                <li><span className="fw-bold">Health and Safety:</span> Ensuring a safe work environment is a key priority under Oman’s labor laws. Employers must take all necessary precautions to protect employees from workplace hazards, provide appropriate safety equipment, and ensure working conditions that prioritize health and well-being.</li>
              </ul>

                For employees, understanding labor laws helps them recognize their rights, seek fair treatment, and report any workplace issues. For employers, knowledge of these laws ensures compliance, reduces legal risks, and fosters a positive workplace culture. Staying informed about Oman’s labor laws helps both parties contribute to a balanced, respectful, and efficient working environment.
