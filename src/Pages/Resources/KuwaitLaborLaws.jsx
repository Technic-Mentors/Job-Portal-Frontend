                Kuwait’s labor laws cover various employment aspects, from contract terms and work hours to wages and employee benefits. Here’s a closer look at some of the primary components:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><span className="fw-bold">Clear Terms of Employment:</span> Employment contracts in Kuwait must be written and clearly outline job duties, salary, working hours, and benefits. This written agreement protects both parties by detailing roles, responsibilities, and expectations.</li>

                <li><span className="fw-bold">Standard Working Hours and Overtime Pay:</span> The typical workweek in Kuwait is eight hours per day, totaling 48 hours. Any additional hours worked entitle employees to overtime pay at legally defined rates. During Ramadan, Muslim employees work reduced hours as part of Kuwait’s labor regulations.</li>

                <li><span className="fw-bold">Timely Wage Payments and Benefits:</span> Kuwait’s labor laws ensure employees receive their wages on time each month. Employees are also entitled to benefits, such as annual leave and paid public holidays, helping them achieve a balanced work-life routine.</li>

                <li><span className="fw-bold">Leave Policies and Employee Rights:</span> Employees in Kuwait are eligible for various types of leave, including annual, sick, and public holiday leave. After one year of continuous service, workers qualify for 30 days of annual leave. Additional provisions cover maternity leave, compassionate leave, and other specific circumstances.</li>

                <li><span className="fw-bold">End-of-Service Compensation:</span> Kuwait’s labor laws guarantee end-of-service benefits for employees, calculated based on their length of service and final salary. This indemnity provides financial stability to employees at the end of their employment.</li>

                <li><span className="fw-bold">Workplace Safety and Health Regulations:</span> Employers in Kuwait are required to provide a safe and healthy work environment. This includes supplying necessary safety gear, conducting regular safety assessments, and enforcing conditions that protect employee health and well-being.</li>
              </ul>
